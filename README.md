# Amazon Container

**Prevent Amazon from tracking your visits to other websites**

This is a fork of [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)

Amazon Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Amazon from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Amazon while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Amazon Container work?

The Add-on keeps Amazon in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Amazon and deletes the cookies that Amazon uses to track you on other websites.

Every time you visit Amazon, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Amazon within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Amazon won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Amazon identity.

## How do I enable Amazon Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Amazon Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/amazon-container/). This will log you out of Amazon and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Amazon and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Amazon Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Amazon or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Amazon Container

## How does this affect Amazon’s features?

Amazon Containers prevents Amazon from linking your activity on other websites to your Amazon identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded Amazon comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into Amazon only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded Amazon comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Amazon

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Amazon will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Amazon completely?

This add-on does not prevent Amazon from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Amazon still will have access to everything that you do while you are on amazon.com or on any Amazon app, including your Amazon comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with Amazon connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Amazon activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Amazon settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Amazon. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
